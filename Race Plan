What program are we going to create?
  We are going to create a racing game. The user will have control of a car and be able to move it around to stay on the road. If we have time and the understanding
  we will implement a car that will run the course that the user can race against.

What technologies will we use?
  We will be using object-orientied programming and importing the arcade library in order to play the game.

What features will we include? The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included.
  Start screen with a list of controls that handle the movement of the car. A timer to track how long it takes to complete the course. Ability to replay
  without exiting the program? Different levels of course difficutly for the user to choose from.
  

What is your timeline?
  Have a race track and moving car by the end of next week!
